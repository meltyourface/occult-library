## INTRODUCTION TO THE THREE DEGREES OF SEX MAGICK

**Three Degrees of Sex Magick: Love and Religion**

**Introduction**:
- Unprejudiced people do not deny the physiological activity of erotogenesis in love and religion
- Psychiatrists like Reich and Jung extensively treat this existence in the psyche
- Example of two individuals involved in both erotogenic love and transcending sexual love: an aging doctor and his wolf refuge

**The Doctor's Wolf Refuge**:
- Doctor felt deeply about the extinction of the Great Gray Wolf of the Northwest
- Decided to have a wolf refuge on his farm, eventually gaining a colony of 12 wolves
- Wolves were not closely confined, but had to mate for life due to their selective nature and mating ritual

**Doctor's Connection with Wolves**:
- Developed a deep affection with one male wolf, which was reciprocated
- Female wolf remained skittish and aloof towards the doctor

**The Doctor's Encounter with Wolves**:
- While in the enclosure of the mated wolves, the doctor stumbled and fell prostrate
- Saw the female ready to attack him, while the male jumped over him and knocked the female down
- This exemplified that real love transcends mere sexual love (wolves mate for life)

**Love, Religion, and the Divine Spirit**:
- In living nature, there is a sentience of something superior to oneself
- Basis of religious feeling, with concomitants like love, aspiration, inspiration, veneration, and joy of existence

**The Concept of "Complex" in Psychology**:
- A system of ideas and/or memories that exerts a dominant influence on the personality
- Can be born from strong feelings and emotions, repeated over time
- Autonomous force that persists without willed intention (psychopathic cases)

**The Willed, Intentional "Bud-Will"**:
- A self-willed and self-directed complex generated through Western Sex Magick
- Genesis requires tremendous emotional and magickal imagination

##### Magickal Imagination and Sexual Enthusiasm in Sufism

**The Power of Musical Inspiration: Kreisler's Gypsy Music and Sex Magick**

**Kreisler Encounter**:
- Met Fritz Kreisler backstage, shared interest in mysticism
- Kreisler played Gypsy music on his violin for the narrator
- Narrator lacked empathy with Hungarian Gypsy music but was enchanted by Kreisler's playing
- Played Kreisler's compositions daily for 12 days, developed appreciation

**Organist Audition**:
- Organist at opposition house was leaving
- Narrator wanted the organist position and played Gypsy music during audition
- Owner was impressed, offered the position

**The Power of Inspiration and Repeatition**:
- Kreisler's playing created a "great fire of the magickal imagination" in the narrator
- This force was kept alive by daily repetition of Kreisler's compositions
- Lack of inspiration and aspiration can lead to a "deadening" of finer sensibilities

**Religious Erotogenesis**:
- Sex, love, aspiration, religion, and magick are often intertwined
- Narrator helped a preacher revitalize his baptismal service
- Used "certain secret, powerful magick technics" to inspire the preacher's wife
- This sex magick "worked greater than [their] fondest hopes" and inspired over 100 people to be submerged in the waters of redemption.

**The Importance of Inspiration and Aspiration**:
- Without inspiration and aspiration, even physical intercourse can lead to a "deadening" of finer sensibilities
- Sex magick, when practiced with intention, can generate and feed the magickal imagination
- Developing the autonomous "Bud-Will" without sex magick is difficult, if not impossible.

##### "Sufi Sex Magick: A Spiritual Perspective on Intimate Relations"

**Sex Magick: Achieving Transcendence Through Imagination**

**Background:**
- George X's business success attributed to religious charm
- Practice of Sufi Sex Magick as the underlying factor
- Importance of intent, aspiration, and imaginative visualization in magick

**Technique:**
1. **Magick with intent**: focus on desired objective
2. **Aspiration**: continuous improvement and spiritual growth
3. **Imagination**: powerful tool for creating subjective reality
4. **Experience partner as Divine Lover**: visualize partner as manifestation of God
5. **Poetic expression:** use of Aleister Crowley's poem "Divine Synthesis" to describe the attitude and experience

**Crowley's Poem "Divine Synthesis":**
- Man reflects on past loves, seeing them as stars reflecting a single sun
- Realizes the truth: women are stars that give him light
- Learns to love undividedly in higher plane
- Undergoes resurrection of Golden Star of Day
- Lives in Him (God) with heart open to purer songs and vigils

**Outcome:**
- Blindly reaching for the glorious and sublime
- Meeting again in the Presence of the Throne, not knowing but in Him.

## ALPHAISM: THE FIRST DEGREE

**Alphaism: The First Degree**

**Definition:**
- Alphaism refers to the foundation of Greek alphabet, Alpha
- Essential for serving as an aid in the techniques of remaining degrees

**Objective:**
- Magickal chastity is the goal
- Does not imply long periods of sexual abstinence

**Myths vs. Reality:**
- No credible evidence of beneficial results from prolonged celibacy
- Sexual leakage during celibacy may increase gonad production

**Aleister Crowley's Testimony:**
- Extended practice of magickal chastity had no impact on his writings
- Orgasmic sex also had no negative effect on writings

**Magickal Chastity:**
- Allows sexual union for pleasure and joy
- Demands it be a dedicated sex magick rite
- Mind, feelings, and imagination should not dwell on sex between congrex

**Importance of Alphaism:**
- Every sexual union is to be an act of Sex Magick
- Intervening periods are for building up forces

**Second Degree Practice:**
- Can help attain proficiency in Alphaism
- Practicing the Second Degree often is pleasurable and not exhausting.

### XI TRUMPS

**XI Trump: Sustained Lust in Ecstasy**
- Pursuit of magickal ecstasy during congrex without rushing for orgasm
- Longer ecstasy increases rite's potency
- Avoid abandoning Divine Lover to reach orgasm
- Symbolizes sustained lust in sexual ecstasy, as depicted in Crowley's Tarot deck
- Source: Aleister Crowley's Tarot deck (Llewellyn Publications, 1971)

## DIANISM: THE SECOND DEGREE

**Dianism: The Second Degree**

**Overview**:
- Dianism refers to a magickal ritual that does not culminate in orgasmic state
- The purpose is to attain certain aspired magickal results through this method

**Comparing Dianism to Karezza and Oneida Community**:
- Karezza taught no climax, but lacked an effective method for preventing frustration
- Oneida Community practiced communal love and religious aspiration without climax, avoiding frustration
- However, Dianism is not derived from Far Eastern Tantric Sex practices

**Tantric Sex Magic**:
- 16 month training curriculum for a high Tantric Master
- First 4 months: practicing asanas (positions) and geometric designs
- Next 8 months: practicing the classical position, no climax
- Man attains psychic powers like predicting future, thought transference, etc.
- Tantric Magic aims at magical powers as an end in itself, not for self-transcendence

**Western Magick vs. Transcendental Magick**:
- Western Magick aims at self-transcendence through spiritual identification
- Dianism and other Western magick practices also aim at attaining magickal powers
- The aspiration for transcendence increases the magick force

**Choosing a Woman Partner**:
- Different men have different requirements
- Patience is key in finding a suitable partner
- A woman obsessed with sensual pleasure or preconceived ideas may not be a good partner

##### "Sexual Magic Rituals: Dianism Technique for Self-Discovery"

**Sexual Magick: The Natural Woman as a Child of Nature**

**The Ideal Sexual Partner:**
- A woman unconditioned by artificialities of city life is a "child of Nature"
- Responds to male aspirations and initiations
- Becomes super magickal partner in conjex

**Conditions for an Effective Conjex:**
- Performed in the dark
- No words spoken
- Both partners undressed
- Slow, unhurried love play before conjex (10 minutes)
- Let imagination reach a vivid state
- No rush to bring individual personalities to background
- Sexual ecstasy welcomed but not obsessed over

**The Divine Lover and the Guardian Angel:**
- Partner is seen as outward manifestation of one's own Guardian Angel
- Regarded as vehicle for divine self (Daemon)
- Aim for union with higher self in conjex

**Practice of Dianism Rite:**
- Hold onto rapture, don't fall into swoon
- Refine ecstasy through art, delicacy, subtlety
- Exceed in joyous actions and thoughts
- Aim for true will (expression of the Daemon) instead of lust for result

**Digression on Dianism:**
- Can be practiced for various purposes as long as objectives align with true nature.

##### The Secrets of Dianism: Magickal Sexual Union and Spiritual Growth

**Dianism Sex Magick Technique**

**Benefits:**
- Leads to complete fulfillment instead of sexual frustration
- Increases magickal sexual force
- Does not deplete physical, mental, emotional, or sexual energy
- Produces astounding and satisfactory results in extended practice
- Induces great suprasensual wisdom and direction for desires

**Maintaining Proper Attitude and Imagination:**
- Do not attempt to delay, quell, or suppress sexual sensation
- No hasty movements or anticipations
- Be neither engrossed in nor obsessed by sexual ecstasy
- Transmute sexual ecstasy into magickal fire for union with soul
- Practice as much as possible

**During Congrex:**
- No words spoken, use prearranged signals for guidance
- Let partner lose all identity and be seen as objective vehicle of one's own soul
- Extend duration of practice over time
- Feelings of peace, contentment, and spiritual rejuvenation should persist

**Importance of Practice:**
- Regularity in practice increases magickal power and energy
- Sexual ecstasy is welcomed but not indulged in as such
- Aim for true will and desire in Magick to be consonant with your nature

**Quoting Aleister Crowley:**
- Practitioners should have knowledge of Holy Guardian Angel
- Aspire to true will and formulate Bud-Will (magickal child) as an Intelligence
- Purify and consecrate this Child, continuing preparation in daily life.

##### "Magickal Imagination and Self-Direction"

**Magickal Imagination and Subjective Reality**

**Making Intensity Through Repetition**:
- Continuous repetition strengthens mental and emotional images
- Allows for autonomous activity without conscious effort
- Leads to a state of "complex" in which subjective experiences feel like objective reality

**Imagination vs. Fancy**:
- Imagination is a creative, willed process of forming mental and emotional images
- Distinguished from arbitrary or capricious "fancy"

**Subjective Reality**:
- Psychologists refer to this state in psychopathic cases
- Can be very real and potent when applied to a preceding subjective reality
- Magickal imagination is self-directed towards creating specific subjective realities

**Exemplars of Subjective Reality**:
1. **Francis X**: Believed Saint Peter was whispering, leading to irrational actions and confinement in an asylum
2. **Psychosomatic Illness**: Drinking "sacred water" from miraculous wells led to instant cures
3. Magickal imagination directed towards positive subjective experiences can lead to real objective reality

**Aleister Crowley's Example: Energised Enthusiasm**
- Imagine everyone at a dance as angels, not just their outward appearances
- Transmute sensory experiences (e.g., music, smells) into something divine
- Dance with the Goddess Isis or your own Divine Lover

**Religion and Natural Veneration**:
- This is not about beliefs or faith, but being in rapport with Living Nature
- Invoking imagination for union with the Divine (Pantheism)
- The imagination is natural, as it connects us to the natural world

### DIANISM ELABORATED

**Dianism Elaborated**

**The Attitude (1)**
- The man should lose awareness of the woman partner as a certain person and be impersonal towards her personality.
- The man should regard the woman partner as a tangible manifestation of his own Daemon, his Divine Lover, who is being transmuted.
- The woman partner may have a climax only if it does not diminish her continuing enjoyment. She should not be sexually aggressive and should not strive for the climax.

**The Sexual Ecstasy (1)**
- The man should welcome the ecstasy but not indulge in it; rather, he should imagine and will that the sexual ecstasy is immediately the continuing fire which feeds the magickal visualization and imagination of being in union with his Soul Lover, his Daemon, and other specific objectives of the rite.
- When well done, this represses the desire for the climax.

**The Climax (1)**
- In the congrex union, the man must not have a climax. The woman partner may have a climax only under certain conditions.
- This rite is to be exclusively concerned with its objectives, never lust for the result of climax. To welcome sexual ecstasy without striving. There is no loss of sexual energy and power of ecstasy, thus enabling one to practice often. It gives an increase in energized force.

**The Magickal Child (1)**
- To create what is variously called the magickal complex, the magickal intelligence, the Magickal Child, and the Bud-Will, which continue in time autonomously.
- The outstanding difference between the Second Degree and the Third Degree is that there is to be no climax in the Second Degree congrex. This is especially applicable to the male. If the woman partner cannot forego the climax for a long period of time, she does not make a good partner except under one condition, that she can continue with sexual enthusiasm even after having a climax. There are some who are amenable to conforming to your explanations and desires. The woman who is sexually aggressive is, in most cases, almost impossible. She diverts the purpose of the man and also makes it too difficult for him to concentrate upon the magickal imagination.

**The Second Degree Working (1)**
- There are several good reasons for the no climax rule:
  - If the man decides that there shall be no strong desire (or force) for the climax, then there will be no diversion from being exclusively concerned with all of the desired objectives of the rite.
  - Although the union be not carried to the point of a frustrating drive for the climax, nevertheless he can (and should) welcome the sexual ecstasy. However, he should not be diverted by indulging himself in the ecstasy. This ecstasy is to feed the fire of the magickal imagination.
- If the woman is also an initiate in the magickal congrex, all rules apply to her as well. Both of you should lose your identity; you must become something else—high ritualists of another world.

**The Ritual (1)**
- The man stands before the woman and says:
  - "Before me, you are a woman known to me as (her name) but in this Great Work of Magick Art I no longer know you by your outer personality."
  - "You are now the High Priestess of this Art, to give your aid and blessing."
  - "You are the Queen who gives the royal benediction to this work of Art."
  - "You are a Goddess—a real Goddess—without whose presence there could be no miracle resulting from this rite of Magick."
- The ritual need not be actually performed but by some manner must you and your partner be brought to the attitude described in the ritual. Both of you should lose your identity; you must become something else—high ritualists of another world.

**The Case History (1)**
- The author's second marriage was with a native Mexican woman who lived close to the border. She had a short-term pass which allowed her to visit him for two days every week.
- The woman would not allow the author to kiss or embrace her, and said "I shall never have any affection for any man: my heart is as hard as a rock."
- However, in the sex congrex she was very ardent.
- The author reasoned that because of her past love affairs, she had steeled herself to be incapable of having love and affection for a man.
- The decision was to bring the congrex to great results by focusing on the woman's latent potential for deep, ardent affection and intense enchantment.
- The author found that if he had a sense of alertness, awareness, and mental resourcefulness, he could stimulate the energized enthusiasm, issuing from a feeling of the seductiveness of the unusual or from a sense of enchantment.

##### Magickal Love Invocation and Consequences

**Magickal Operation Techniques: Trance and Invocation**

**Trance Congregations (Borderland State of Consciousness)**
- Lasts for two to four hours
- Achieves a state between being awake and asleep
- Slows down body motions, lessens conscious awareness
- Prepares for next grade in Great Work: union with Guardian Angel

**Magickal Powers**
- Automatically given based on unique nature and needs
- Consonant with self's nature for attainment of the Great Work
- No specific invocation required for Second or Third Degree workings

**Invocation of Magickal Powers: Attraction of a Suitable Wife**
- Neglected social life, sought good wife but no prospects
- Invoked power to attract women's interest
- Envisioned marrying a woman within five minutes of meeting her if attracted
- Received seven quick engagements but none were suitable matches
- Constructed invocation for a good and mutually affectionate wife.

**Daemon (Guardian Angel)**
- Invoked as Daemon or Guardian Angel in magickal practices
- Necessary for energized enthusiasm, magickal imagination
- Testified by mystics and magicians like Carl Jung
- Atheists may admit existence for the purpose of practicing Magick sincerely.

##### "Dianism: A Spiritual Practice for Visionary Experiences and Materialistic Results"

**Dianism Trance Experience**
- Results of Dianism trance:
    - Happy and affectionate marriage
    - Delicious languor
    - Near dreamy state
    - Marvelous inspirations, almost visionlike
    - Assurance of being in loving, protecting arms of one's Lover Daemon
    - Scintillating variations in result
    - Directions for results can be based on aspirations or desires
    - Materialistic results consonant with Great Work
- Extended Dianism rite:
    - Identification with the Angel is important
    - Submergence of partner's identity, at least partially
    - Borderland State: slight trancelike state or jug dipping water from ocean and pouring it onto the ground
        * No feeling of loss after orgasm
        * Seven Pointed Star of Babalon represents Great Mother of Sex Magick and feminine aspect of Pan
- Skeptic's challenge:
    - Practice extended Dianism rite until attaining Borderland State
    - Inspiring visions and transcendent illumination are guaranteed, even if initial experience is just delicious languor and feeling of love and peace.

## QUODOSCH: THE THIRD DEGREE

**Third Degree Magick: Quodosch**

**Potential Uses of Third Degree**
- Charging letters with will (Sex Magick)
- Transcending woman partner
- Interspersing Second and Third Degree rituals for balance

**Importance of Awareness in Magick**
- Swear oath of intent: regard every incident as a possible sign from the Daemon and Bud-Will Intelligence
- Vigilance is crucial to successful magickal workings

**Exemplar Story: "Lou" and Alice**
- Incompatible couple planning separation
- Husband's desire for magickal partner led him to recognize potential in Alice during car ride
- Recognized woman as possible sign of Bud-Will Intelligence at work
- Offered help, which led to a deeper connection and eventually marriage with Alice's sister Mabel.

**Caution: Misuse of Power**
- Discretion and selectivity are key to prevent harm in magickal practices
- Every person is unique and should be treated as such

**Exemplar Story Detail**
- Man named Lou picked up hitchhiker Alice
- Recognized potential connection with Bud-Will Intelligence during interaction
- Offered help, which led to deeper connection and eventually marriage with her sister Mabel.

##### The Magickal Union: Alchemical Practice and Sexual Initiation

**Alchemy and Sexual Magick**

**The Dude's Experience**:
- The dude played it cautious at first, but Mabel's suspicions were raised
- The dude tried to charm Mabel, saying "I'm going to get some of that stuff"
- Mabel responded by taunting the dude and slapping him in the face
- Ed laughed at the dude's "more ambition than good judgment"

**Alchemy and Transmutation**:
- Alchemists tried to transmutate base elements into rare or valuable chemicals
- The dude saw the alchemical process as a "magickal ritual" of refining and developing his higher potential
- The dude attained a real initiation through his alchemical work

**Alchemic Symbols**:
- **Cucurbit**: The female organ, per se
- **Alembic Retort**: The same organ in process of transmutation
- **Menstruum**: The magick solvent of the female organ
- **Eagle/White Eagle**: The female/female essence
- **Lion/Red Lion**: The male/male essence
- **Sublimate**: Exalt and refine the physical for transmutation
- **Transmutation**: Metaphorically changing base metal to gold, or physical ecstasy to spiritual ecstasy
- **Elexir/Quintessence**: The transmuted sexual essence
- **Transubstantiation**: The magickal process of the "flesh and blood" of the god being present in consecrated bread and wine

**Alchemic Processes**:
- **Yesod**: Simple, instinctive union with feelings and emotions
- **Tiphareth**: Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel (below the grade of actual union)
- **Chokmah/Binah**: Masculine wisdom/feminine understanding, respectively
- **The Abyss**: A psychic disaster for the presumptuous, unworthy person
- **Kether**: The high sphere where human and divine wisdom merge

**Quodosch vs. Dianism**:
- Quodosch includes the conjoined menstruum of the White Eagle and the essence of the Red Lion, which is transmuted to the quintessence
- This vital force can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the mucous membranes, like with oysters

##### "Aleister Crowley's Guide to Magickal Practices"

**The Wise Alchemist's Transmutation Process**

**The Great Work**:
- The "Great Work" refers to transubstantiation, the medicine of metals, royal antimony, and quintessence
- The Red Lion feeds on the flesh and blood of the God, and the White Eagle is sustained by this process

**Anointing Ritual**:
- There is great virtue in using the Anointing Ritual for various purposes:
  - Letters, talismans, magick sigils, symbols of aspiration, or upon living flesh

**Emotions and Custom**:
- People may react negatively to things that are different from their customary thoughts, emotions, and actions
- They may label it as mysterious, weird, evil, or dangerous

**Attaining Divine Spirit**:
- Any method aimed at attaining a closer awareness of the Divine Spirit or the Knowledge and Conversation of the Guardian Angel is not evil or wicked
- The Lion should have a conscience about imposing upon the Eagle when the operation is for the Lion's benefit

**Double Concentration and Magickal Imagination**:
- Zelator must perform the congrex with all attitudes set forth in the Second Degree
- Concentrate on the desired purpose during the congrex

**Methods of Application**:
1. **Letter Method**: 
   - Use quintessence on a letter for a particular purpose, then seal and mail it
2. **Money Method**: 
   - Apply the same as in the Letter Method for financial objectives
3. **Mental and Emotional Improvement**:
   - Concentrate on the desired propensity (joy, concentration, love, etc.) while using quintessence
4. **Divination**:
   - Choose a preferred divinatory method and visualize the symbol during the congrex
5. **Awareness**:
   - Cultivate keen and active awareness to recognize clues in sight or feelings
6. **The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel**:
   - Identify the partner as a spiritualized manifestation of the Divine Daemon, not a known person
   - The central aim is to attain this union, the true definition of initiation

**Magickal Powers**:
- These powers are automatically attained when focusing on the central aim of the Great Work

##### The Rite of Transubstantiation and Sexual Magick in Ancient Cultures

**The Rite of Transubstantiation and Sex Magick**

**Importance of Rite**:
- No sexual congrex should take place without this rite
- Physical, psychological, and spiritual benediction is too great to be neglected
- The Rite of Transubstantiation sums up the ritual in Christianity

**Consecration of Spiritual Substance**:
- In magickal rite, there is an actual vital spiritualized substance that is consecrated
- This is a sufficient hint to the wise: to the troglodytes, the whole subject of Magick must remain as ignorance and anathema

**Argument Against Sex Magick**:
- Some object to Sex Magick on grounds that the sexual act is solely for procreation
- They base their argument on animal behavior, ignoring the spiritual and psychological part
- This argument is flawed due to the difference between humans and animals in reproductive cycles

**The Bud-Will Intelligence (Magickal Child)**:
- A complex is a group of ideas and feelings heavily charged with energy that functions autonomously to influence personality and behavior
- When generated through Sex Magick, it can aid and serve the individual, even leading to genius
- This functioning intelligence is like a magickal offspring or child, which should not be overlooked

**Ancient Practices**:
- Certain ancient Semitic peoples practiced certain forms of Sex Magick, including concentrating on the nature of the child during congrex and blessing their son later in life
- Consuming the "God Eater" substance (semen) was a secret practice among some initiates to attain godlike knowledge or power

**Quintessence of Sexual Fluid**:
- Transmuting this effluvium into an elixir (quintessence) is a highly secret practice, as it is distasteful in its untransmuted form
- The real magickal use of the quintessence is outlined, which is not for sexual rejuvenation but for other aims in Sex Magick

**Invocation to the "Bornless One" (Daemon)**:
- Sex Magick should fundamentally contain the invocation to the "bornless one," the Higher Genius, the Daemon

### THE MAGICKAL CHILD

- Multiple names reflect different evocations/invocations, willed manifestations

**Responsibility and Ethics:**
- Importance of clear intent for spiritual transcendence

##### Reformed Palladian Order: A Controversial Esoteric Movement

**Dianism Experiment Results:**
- Far surpasses other methods for self-transcendence in six months practice (only Second Degree)
- Unbelievable to many readers due to lack of emphasis on Sex Magick in literature

- Special bed sheet for conjuring and incantations
- Special kissing spot on partner's body
- Pantacle design to represent magickal aspiration and anoint it with essence
- Write powerful letters on specially anointed paper

- Initial membership growth due to Thomas Vaughan's reputation as mystic and occultist
- Leo Taxil and Sachs (Dr. Battaille) were founders and propagandists
- Hostility from Church and government despite lack of solid evidence of hoaxes
- Mrs. Nestor Webster defends the Order in her book "Secret Societies and Subversive Movements" and Catholic encyclopedia

### APPENDIX IV THE YI KING AND SEX MAGICK

**Yi King and Sex Magick**

**Background:**
- Ancient Chinese used Yi King Oracle for determining sexual union favorability and nature
- Three methods to cast hexagrams: bottom up, hour method, or during Dianism (method three is most practical)

**Methods of Casting Hexagrams:**
1. **Bottom up method**:
   - Wife concentrates on first mental picture of one trigram
   - Husband does the same
   - Resultant hexagram describes nature and favorability of next sexual union
2. **Hour method**:
   - Look up most favorable times based on hexagram rulership in hour table
   - Choose a hexagram number for your purpose
   - Determine correct time considering meridian time and daylight savings
3. **During Dianism:**
   - Hexagrams 60, 61, 62, 63, and 64 are good for husband's imagination and invoking inspiration from Divine Lover or Holy Guardian Angel. Wife can aid in this special inspiration reflecting back to her.

**Interpretation of Hexagrams:**
- **Khien (no line of Yin):**
  - Not a good augury for intimate relations between man and wife
  - Just "great starting energy"
- **Air of Khien:**
  - Superficial physical sensuality but no value in a substantial way
  - Auspicious for mutual aspiration in preparation for future time
- **Sun of Khien:**
  - Brilliant realization of masculine type, not usually good for Sex Magick
  - If wife is capable of high aspiration and inspiration, it can be excellent
- **Earth of Khien:**
  - Brings things to a consolidation and fixed material solidity
  - Husband can inspire wife with due diligence in slow but determined way.
